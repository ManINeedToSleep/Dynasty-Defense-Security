# Dynasty Defense Alarm System

This project implements a **robust alarm system** for enclosed structures, utilizing a network of geographically distributed sensors for **fire, smoke, and heat detection**. It offers advanced configuration and monitoring capabilities to enhance safety and security.

## Key Features

### **1. Sensor Monitoring and Configuration:**  
- Administrators can **configure sensitivity** and **response parameters** for fire, smoke, and heat sensors.  
- Real-time monitoring of all connected sensors with a detailed control interface.  
- Occupants can **reset** or **deactivate specific sensors or sensor types** directly from the control panel.  

### **2. Alarm Triggering and Notification:**  
- Sensors trigger **audible** and/or **visual alarms** upon detection of fire, smoke, or heat.  
- Instant **notifications via chat** sent to designated users, including alarm type and sensor details for quick action.  

### **3. Secure User Management:**  
- **Password-protected access** to the Alarm Control Panel (ACP).  
- **Enforced password complexity requirements:**  
  - Minimum 16 characters.  
  - At least one special character.  
  - At least one uppercase letter.  
- Secure password storage in **Local Storage**, ensuring data safety.

## System Architecture

The **Dynasty Defense Alarm System** comprises the following components:  

1. **Sensors:**  
   Distributed across the structure to detect **fire, smoke, and heat** in real-time.  

2. **Alarm Control Panel (ACP):**  
   The central system used for configuring and managing sensors and alarms.  

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
   Provides both **administrators** and **occupants** with a clear interface to monitor, control, and reset the system.
